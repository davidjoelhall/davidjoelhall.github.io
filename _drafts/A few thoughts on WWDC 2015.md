#A few thoughts on WWDC 2015

## Notes

* surprising inclusion on this app, which hasn't gotten much attention since the lackluster *redesign* in iOS 7. 
* includes sketching, photo import, checklists
* is it still IMAP on the backend? Does it sync only to Notes on the Mac?

##QuickType

* Adjusted keyboard to make the key caps lowercase until the shift key is pressed, solid adjustment. 
* 2 finger swipe on the keyboard to move the cursor between text 
* Adjustable [Shortcut Bar](http://www.apple.com/ios/ios9-preview/#gallery-quicktype/show/gallery-quicktype-view-shortcutbar)

##Siri

I've been using Siri for a little while now, use it multiple times a day on my iPhone and Watch. In iOS 9, it looks to have gained partial spacial recognition. Not quite to the level that Google announced with Google Now at Google I/O, but convenient nonetheless. When looking at a website for instance, you will be able to say "remind me about *this* later today" and Siri will create a reminder about the site you're looking at. 

Natural language to bring up photos also looks pretty great. "Show me photos from Christmas last year" and just browse through them. 

###watchOS

3rd party complications

* tasks (I'm looking at you [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/))
* sports scores
* HomeKit (think opening door locks or turning off lights)

Time Travel

* easily view calendar events that may be coming up through the day by just turning the Digital Crown
* interested to see how this works with 3rd party complications (OmniFocus)

Hopes for HomeKit-

* iBeacons or something like it... So my iPhone and other devices can be spatially aware of where they are in my house. Give me certain features when I'm in the kitchen compared to when I'm in the living room.
