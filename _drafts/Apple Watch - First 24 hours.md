My first 24 hours with Apple Watch

I sit here 16 hours into my first day… with 48% battery left. That’s pretty good I’d say… let’s take a step back and see how I got here.

I agree with the statement made in many other *reviews*… The Apple Watch is as much a “watch” as the original iPhone was a “phone”. This is a magnificent piece of hardware, especially considering this is a 1.0 — tied with a surprisingly good 1.0 version of the software. I read the reviews from a lot of the tech press. I read Gruber’s. I read Stern’s. I read Patel’s. I agree with some of the things… but the biggest “FU” I saw was a glaring omission to simply culling your own notifications. I did this just after the setup of my device and my wrist wasn’t buzzing all day and the buzzes I did get were things I *wanted*.

I purchased the Apple Watch with a black Sports band. Immediately when I received the package from my UPS man late last night, who said when he delivered it:

>Someone is going to be really happy, whoever the recipient of this package is… they’re going to be a happy camper.

Upon receiving the package… I felt the heft. I handed it to my wife… she said the same thing, “this is your *Watch*? It’s heavy…” I immediately tore open the box to see a brilliant white box in a clear plastic wrap. Even the plastic wrap is thoughtfully placed around the box… Apple is a true product boxing expert if I ever knew one. 

The setup of the Watch is smart. They use a modern-era, custom even, QR style code. You turn on the Watch, open the Watch app on your iPhone, tap “Start Pairing” on each device, and point the iPhone’s camera at the Watch which automatically starts the pairing.

I finished off the night with not too much fuss… the charging…
