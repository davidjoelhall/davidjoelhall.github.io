What's the plan in the event that something goes wrong and the data on your computer is no longer available/readable?

Do you pay for a data recovery service? Do you try the old fashioned "[hard drive in a freezer](http://lifehacker.com/5515337/save-a-failed-hard-drive-in-your-freezer-redux)" trick? Do you just throw up your hands and give up? Well, hopefully none of the above… because you've thought ahead and you have a backup (read: contingency) plan. Here's my plan.

# Local storage (done weekly)

I have two things being done locally…
First is a Time Machine backup to my [Synology](http://www.synology.com/) [DS411](http://www.synology.com/us/products/DS411/). The beautiful thing about this, is that there was almost no setup required. Just enable a share on the DS411 with Time Machine and connect your Mac to it and done.
Second is a [SuperDuper](http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html) clone (created as a .sparsebundle which can be updated later) to two locations, one on the DS411 and another copy to a separate Western Digital My Passport drive. Again, almost no setup required… Connect the share (or physical drive) you want to put the clone on and either start a full backup or a "Smart Update" (this feature will remove and add files where necessary to make the clone the same as the current drive, it's a much faster process than an entirely new backup).

# Off-site (yet still local) storage (done bi-weekly)

This is a bit of a simpler process… on the average, I'll take my mom out to lunch on a weekly or bi-weekly basis… while we're out to lunch, I'll setup my MacBook Air to backup to a local drive that is stored at her house. So, in the event that the house that I currently occupy were to be the victim of a robbery or a fire, I have a backup at the ready.

 # Online storage (continuous)

For my online storage solution, I went with CrashPlan's [CrashPlan+](http://www.crashplan.com/consumer/crashplan-plus.html). It's the most bang for your buck service that I found. It runs very quietly in the background… it will let you configure many options regarding the backup (e.g. folders to include/exclude) and how much system resources it takes and when. Not only all this… but you can also have it be configured to backup to a peer that is on the CrashPlan network. You both setup the software and you can point your computer to your peer and your peer can point theirs to yours, all of which is free - pretty slick. The only downer, thought it really doesn't effect me, but since it's there… I'll mention it: the possibility of throttled (reduced speed) uploads. Since I don't have extremely fast upload speeds (~5 Mbps), I don't have to worry about a throttled connection… where as if I had a large pipe for upload (~30+ Mbps), I may be upset that I couldn't get my data to them as fast I'd like to.

I do all the above (with the exception of the off-site storage) for my wife's computer too. 

Prior to this plan… I just used Time Machine and a SuperDuper clone whenever I remembered to do it. The motivation behind this 'elaborate' plan? Photos of our wedding. I couldn't afford to lose those photos. Not only because the wedding was expensive, but that event cannot be duplicated. The memories that were had that day were for the ages and I would like to be able to look back at those photos in twenty years with my wife and think, "man… that was one heck of a night… good times."
All in all… just ask yourself one thing: if you lose everything on your computer, how much would you pay to get it back? Now consider the cost of "full-proof" solution as I have. The cost to the solution compared to data recovery (if it's possible)? Pennies on the dollar. Think about it. It's worth it.
