Here's a novel idea. Ship books as text. If piracy is a concern, ship text encrypted. You cannot read the text without a key. You purchase the key, you get the text. What happens after the fact is no different then what happens today. 

You could then style the text how you want, you could break it up in chunks how you want, you could then easily give it to a screen reader to read for you. 

Books as plain text, with encryption as needed.
