I want to have specific dates on the calendar marked for people to remember things about them... Yes, you can have anniversaries and birthdays... but what about other things? 

- the date of when you met someone 
- when someone started their job 
- when you moved into your house 

Birthdays and anniversaries  are covered by built in options thankfully, but what about everything else, the "custom" options. Those things are not covered by contacts. Sure, you can put these things onto a custom calendar, but they're not then tied to the person and as the person changes, the calendar needs to then also be updated. Someone stops one job and starts another, you should change that on their contact card. 

I was hoping that a "system" like Flexibits' Fantastical and Cardhop or BusyMac's BusyCal and BusyContacts would do this, but it doesn't appear that way. 

This doesn't appear to be a limitation of the CardDAV protocol, though I'm not sure that iCloud, Flexibits, or BusyMac use CardDAV necessarily behind the scenes and not their own flavor of syncing.
