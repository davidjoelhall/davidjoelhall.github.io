I don't know about you, but last I checked... I am not LeBron James. Unfortunately for me, I'm not Federer either. I'm not Patrick Mahomes... I'm not a modern day Einstein. All of that to say is while I'm not #1 in any particular field... I use a ven diagram of different skills that makes me successful in my own way. LeBron James does not have my skills nor my experience. If you wanted to hire LeBron James to do what I do, you'd be wasting your money. 

Naval later added to this idea:

> Let’s say there’s 10,000 areas that are valuable to the human race today in terms of knowledge to have, and the number one in those 10,000 slots is taken [so you can't take one of these spots unless you already have it]. Someone else is likely to be the number one in each of those 10,000, unless you happen to be one of the 10,000 most obsessed people in the world that at a given thing. But when you start combining, well, number 3,728 with top-notch sales skills and really good writing skills and someone who understands accounting and finance really well, when the need for that intersection arrives, you’ve expanded enough from 10,000 through combinatorics to millions or tens of millions. So, it just becomes much less competitive. Also, there’s diminishing returns. So, it’s much easier to be top 5 percentile at three or four things than it is to be literally the number one at something.

Like Naval, I'm not striving to be #1 of something... that requires far too much work and in some cases I do not have the talent or abilities to become #1... but I can be top 5% of a particular ability in my town. Pair that with social and communication skills... and now we have something that is better in certain situations. 

So, while you may not be LeBron. You're you. Lean into that.
