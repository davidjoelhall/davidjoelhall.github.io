[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and [Loom](http://loom.com). Two different solutions to potentially the same problem, or are they complimentary services to provide benefit to one another?

Loom can monitor a folder on the Mac. What folder should be used? Dropbox/Pictures? Remember, you don't want to have your photos only live in Loom. Granted, Loom states that they won't touch the original files (photos/videos):
>Does Loom own any rights to the photos I have in my Loom library?
No. Your Loom library is 100% yours, and always will be. You retain all rights to the photos and videos you have in your Loom library, and they are accessible only by you. [[Source](https://loom.com/faq#does-loom-own-any-rights-to-the-photos-i-have-in-my-loom-library)]

This is promising, they (your photos) aren't sold or misused by the company you're entrusting your photos in.

So, this begs the question. Why use Loom and Dropbox? Well... That's what I'm trying to find out.

A short aside about backing up your photos.
The few rules I try to maintain to important information:

1. Never leave your photos to a single location (e.g. redundant back up).
2. Never leave your photos to an online system, only (i.e. have a local copy).
3. Never leave your photos to a single medium (e.g. have an online back up and a local copy or have multiple local back ups)

Now back to the topic at hand. 

New photos taken on iPhone and/or Canon 550D (T2i) > imported to Camera Uploads either via Mac's image capture (550D) or Dropbox's Camera Upload from iOS (iPhone) > Sorted via Hazel to Dropbox/Photos/YYYY/YYYY-MM/ based on "Crestion Date" > Loom monitors Dropbox/Photos and will upload the files to their cloud for use on their iOS apps.

Now why not just use local storage and Dropbox *or* Loom?
