Steph Ango gave me a good idea, "how I use X" as a way to outline how I use a particular thing. Here's [his post](https://stephango.com/vault) for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). 

I share some similarities to Steph in that I believe in the philosophy of [file over app]() where the general idea that your files you not be tied to an app, your files should be able to outlive the app as many apps change, stop functioning, etc.

In my case, for now, the app I use is DEVONthink.

DEVONthink imports files to be able to reference them in the system. Said another way, DEVONthink is a database on top of your files. The files themselves are imported as-is and not in a custom format. The files are on disk (not as compatible as say, Obsidian, but nearly as so).

What do I use DEVONthink for?

### Daily Notes

On most days, I capture _things_. May be as simple as a place I went, a person I met, or something I saw. 

### References

This is where I store _something_ for _something_. 

As an example, maybe I went to a restaurant. I'll put a reference here about the restaurant with the website, pictures, etc.. That way I can refer to this bit and see where I'm referencing it from here. 

### Clippings

Sometimes I find something interesting on the web, this is where I store the thing. I'll save it in its entirety as a webarchive and/or PDF. Things on the Internet go away at a moments notice and if I'm referring to something, I'd like to refer to something that is under my control (as much as anything is ever under one's control).
