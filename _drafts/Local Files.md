There's a saying in I.T.:

> You never got fired for buying Cisco. 

You know what else you've never got fired for? Having local files. Relying on someone else's cloud service to do your job leads to problems. If you are reliant on someone else for the core of your responsibilities, you'll soon have no responsibilities (said another way, you'll be promoted to client). 

There are too many cases where someone a cloud provider has changed terms of services, offerings, gone dark with short notice. 

Now, sure... I'm not not necessarily responsible for the core of macOS, Windows, and/or Linux... but I have far more trust that the core of these OS will not change in a meaningful way to disrupt my access to my files. However, you know what... having local files will always be local to me. No Internet? No problem. Software provider goes dark? No problem. Maintenance with the software provider causing poor performance or intermittent connectivity? No problem.
