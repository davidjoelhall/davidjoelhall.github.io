You may be looking for an app that gives a different (hopefully better) experience than the app that came with your iPhone. This will be a multipart series in what I've found to be the best-in-class for what to replace the stock apps with. One major downside to replacing the stock experience is you can't change the default app links (e.g. if you click on a link in your Messages app, it'll open Safari -- no two ways about it). 

### Calculator

There are a few solutions for this:
- simple calculation? Stock calculator used from Control Center
- complex calculation? Pcalc
- Excel-ish replacement? Soulver
