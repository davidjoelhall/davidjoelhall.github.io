You may be looking for an app that gives a different (hopefully better) experience than the app that came with your iPhone. This will be a multipart series in what I've found to be the best-in-class for what to replace the stock apps with. One major downside to replacing the stock experience is you can't change the default app links (e.g. if you click on a link in your Messages app, it'll open Safari -- no two ways about it). 

### Notes

Let's face something: notes is far too simplistic in nature. I'll give two recommendations here, one for *just* text notes and what I use for long term (archive) notes and for reference materials. 

First -- text based notes and only text based notes. 

Drafts. I use this as the launching point for anything to do with text. If I need to type something, I tap Drafts. It's fast and simple - no fuss. I open it and I'm at a blank draft with a keyboard ready to go. From there I have actions set up to send the text to a series of different places: SMS, Evernote, email, etc. Why not just use Notes? Notes is slow, doesn't always open to the same spot, and has a shallow feature set. If you want to *do* anything with your note, you're limited to the iOS share sheet and/or copy/paste. 

Second -- text based notes and everything else. 

Evernote. Evernote is your digital filing cabinet and is what gives you the memory of an elephant (the icon isn't by happenstance). I mentioned Evernote above as a place where Drafts text items can be sent to and I definitely use that action... but Evernote is so much more. Here are a few examples of what I do with Evernote:

- I store manuals (PDFs) for everything I own as reference material 
- I store scans that have been OCR'd (optical character recognition) which then is searchable within Evernote 
- I store transcripts of phone calls that need to be referenced later
- emails can be forwarded to your account and stored as reference material. 
- using If This Then That (IFTTT) I store favorited tweets, blog posts, podcast show notes for future reference.
- using Launch Center Pro (LCP) and IFTTT I store photos for reference, e.g. when we painted our house, I took a photo of the paint can / color and put it in Evernote. Now whenever I go to Home Depot to get it, I have the exact match.
- a project you're working that may span different locations and different types of work. You can add a screenshot of a Google Earth map to each location, you can add notes about each specific type of work, etc. 

10 years ago all these things would have to be written / printed and then stored physically in a cabinet somewhere. Today, everything is digital and lives with me everywhere I go on every device I own.
