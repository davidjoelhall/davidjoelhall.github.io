I wonder what features make people jump ship... it's big investment to put your notes somewhere and you put a lot of trust in that system. 

For me, I jumped from Evernote to DEVONthink when I found that:
- search wasn't reliable
- data was stored in a proprietary database
- export was to an HTML file of sorts
