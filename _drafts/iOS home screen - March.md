Desert Golfing. What a simple yet addictive game. I have a couple other games in my queue, not sure if Desert Golfing has an end though... 

I'm trying a new app to wrangle my budget, it's You Need A Budget (YNAB). I'm only a month in right now. It's a lot more work than Mint, but that is the idea. Mint just gives you an overview, but you don't get the feeling of responsibility. 

As the weather changes regularly here, I'm thankful for Check The Weather's widget in the Today view. 

Some staples never change:

* Launch Center Pro
* Drafts
* Evernote
* Pocket
* Reeder
* Fantastical

Overcast is steadily making its way to the list of staples. Marco Arment has done great work on this, despite being pulled from every which direction.
