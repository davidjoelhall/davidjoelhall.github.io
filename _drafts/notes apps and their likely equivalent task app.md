There's something oddly satisfying about using the right tool for the job. Not to mention, not all tools are for all people. They may look nice or even feel great in the hand, but how to use them may not _jive_ with you. 

Here are a few notes app and what I believe their likely equivalent task app. This is not a set in stone list, but based on the general _vibe_ / personality of the app, these feel as they go together:

- Craft is to Things
- DEVONthink is to OmniFocus
- Evernote is to Todoist

## Craft and Things

Design orientated. 

## DEVONthink and OmniFocus

Powerful, offline, and deep linking. 

## Evernote and Todoist

Web based, cross platform.
