The two behemoths in the "read later" service, in my opinion, are [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com) [[iOS - $3.99](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8)] and [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) [[iOS - FREE](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-formerly-read-it-later/id309601447?mt=8)]. They each have pros and cons for a variety of different things. I'll be focusing my attention on what matters to me in a read later service:

* sharing
* favorites
* automatic day/night mode
* text options
* importing

# SHARING

### Pocket
Tapping the share icon will bring up a share sheet consisting of "send to friend "+ the 5 most recent actions followed by a "more" button that will bring you to the main list of all available actions. I didn't see a way to edit these actions, so it seems to be an all inclusive list. Many of these actions I'll probably never use. 

### Instapaper 
Tapping the share icon will bring up a list giving you:

- Delete
- share
- open in browser

I'd much rather have separate icons for Delete/Browser... but that's another story for another day. 
Once you tap Share, it'll take you to the main list view of share options. 

# FAVORITES
In each app, they handle this function differently.

**Pocket** provides a star in the menu bar where it'll be more or less categorized as a Favorite. You can then open the "basement" (tap the triple line / hamburger button) from the start page and then get to your favorites. Aside from seeing a list of your favorites, that's about all the star does from within the app. You can integrate [If This Then That (IFTTT)](http://ifttt.com), but that's outside of this comparison. 

**Instapaper** shows a heart instead of Pocket's star and there's more to "love" for that. Within instapaper! you can have it automatically do things based on tapping the heart:

- Posting to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and/or Pinboard
- Saving to Evernote

Not to sell Pocket short here, you can send to each of the same services as different shares, but they're not automatic nor are they a single action. Pocket actually supports more sharing options, e.g. Wordpress, Reddit, and Buffer. Pocket also supports a lot of third party apps. However, these apps aren't shown on the sharing screen (unless already installed) nor is there a place within the app to see what apps could be used. This begs the question... Where do you see what's supported by Pocket? Visit Pocket's [app directory](https://getpocket.com/apps/). 



# AUTOMATIC DAY/NIGHT MODE

Unfortunately, **Pocket** doesn't offer an automatic day/night mode. You can change the colors within the text selection, so at least there's that.

**Instapaper** has an automatic day/night mode including an optional Sepia mode to use in between these two extremes. The great part? It's automatic by location on a map (e.g. longitude and latitude coordinates). 

Winner: Instapaper.

# SENDING TO READ LATER

Second only to reading, the most important feature is being able to send content *to* read later.
