# Products

### Apple iPhone 7 Plus (Jet Black)

The best iPhone. Period.
Fantastic display, all-day battery, and an outstanding camera.

### Apple Watch Series 0 (Stainless Steel, 42mm, Black Sport Band)

I’ve yet to upgrade to Series 1 or 2… The Series 0 is serving my needs OK for now. If I can find a deal on a Series 2, I’ll upgrade. If not, I’ll wait until Series 3.


### Canon 80D with 50mm ƒ/1.4 prime lens

The iPhone 7 Plus has a great camera… but it’s no DSLR. When I’m after the best shot, I bring this setup. I really would like to get a 24-70 lens, but I haven’t pulled the trigger on that. 

# Apps and Services

### Plex

My own personal “Netflix” if you will. I provide the content and Plex provides an easy way to watch/stream from anywhere I am.

### Square Cash

Splitting a check? Need to be reimbursed? Easy with Square Cash. Link up your debit card and have the funds within 24 hours.

### Dropbox

No explanation necessary.

### Overcast

I listen to podcasts. I listen to a lot of podcasts. Overcast helps with an easy to use interface and two killer features: Smart Speed and Voice Boost. I’ve tried to turn off both features and it’s a wildly different listening experience.

### Foursquare/Swarm

Check in where I go. Jot down notes of what I find interesting. Share with the community. One of the best communities on any service.

### OmniFocus

This is where all of my tasks go. Tasks are organized by project and context, so wherever I am I can get a quick look at what is asked of me.

### nvNotes

This is where all of my notes go. Gift ideas, miscellaneous information about a desk I’m researching, directions on how to cook something… all here.

### Photos and Google Photos

I use them both, for different reasons. Photos as it’s built-in. Google Photos for the quick searching and server based *machine learning*.
