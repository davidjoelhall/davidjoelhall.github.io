After purchasing the [Vizio P65-C1](https://www.vizio.com/p65c1.html) on the [recommendation of The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-tv/), I got into looking at possible expansion in audio. Cue the [SONOS PLAYBAR](http://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/playbar.html).

I already have SONOS equipment sprinkled throughout the home, so the PLAYBAR was a logical step for my home theater setup, regardless of how costly the device may be. Prior to making the purchase, I tweeted out to [@SONOS](https://twitter.com/sonos) and [@VIZIO](https://twitter.com/vizio) to see if there was anything I should be aware of… good thing I did.

I knew that SONOS did not support DTS (Dedicated to Sound), only Dolby Digital. My TV (according to the support manual ([PDF](https://cdn.vizio.com/documents/p50c1/um-p50c1.pdf)) supports DTS, not Dolby Digital. Not a problem, I thought… I'll send the audio *directly* from the source, my Apple TV! Again, I was let down… the latest [Apple TV](http://www.apple.com/apple-tv/specs/) removed the optical audio port in favor of … nothing, nothing replaced it.

This means that I cannot route, from the Apple TV, audio to the PLAYBAR and video to the TV. If I route the audio from the TV to the PLAYBAR, I lose out anything over stereo — which is why I'd be getting directly from the TV without the PLAYBAR.

My solution for the time being: built-in speakers.

Why not get a Vizio soundbar? The SONOS PLAYBAR would have integrated with the network of SONOS PLAY devices I already have, the Vizio soundbar will be a pretty limited device — only for TV playback. The PLAYBAR would have been for TV playback and then be able to be grouped with the other members of the SONOS family for a truly immersive group play throughout the house.

Why not get a different source, like a Roku? Apps. I prefer the App Store on the Apple TV. All of the apps I've ever used have a polish and thoughtfulness to them that I don't see on Roku or Amazon Fire TV.

Here's to hoping the next version of the Apple TV has digital out. Fingers crossed.
