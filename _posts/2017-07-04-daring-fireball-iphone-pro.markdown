>If it’s true that Apple is going to release three new iPhones, my bet is that they’re named the iPhone 7S, iPhone 7S Plus, and iPhone Pro. And I hope the iPhone Pro starts at $1500 or higher. I’d like to see what Apple can do in a phone with a higher price.

I’m expecting the same. The rumors as of late seem to have the iPhone 8/Pro in their sights. I don’t believe we’ve seen/heard anything about the 7S and 7S Plus models.
