While watching a baseball game on the nation's birthday, I noticed the seemingly backwards flag on a player's left jersey sleeve. When I asked the group of people I was with about it, I didn't hear any reasonable answers... so I looked into it and came across this [site](http://www.usflag.org/flagpatch.html). Turns out the field of stars on the flag is on the side nearest the front of the "vessel", or in this case the front of the player. Makes sense.
