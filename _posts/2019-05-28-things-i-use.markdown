As a sort of remembrance for myself, I'm cataloguing what I have in my EDC (Every Day Carry). These are the items I don't leave the house without. If it's in my EDC, it's been "battle tested" and I find it to be useful enough to warrant a spot in my EDC. 

Here's the list of _things_, I'll go into each one in depth after:

- keys
- phone
- wallet
- headphones

### Keys

Thankfully, I don't have many keys nowadays. House, mailbox, work, and car. All of these items are on a single key ring and I don't think about it too much. 

### Phone

iPhone XS. For funsies, here's my home screen as it's setup today:

### Wallet

Over the last 5 years, since I backed their initial [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1562350776/zenlet-amazingly-intuitive-wallet), I've been using a Zenlet wallet. 

There are some pretty great features of this wallet: 

- always the same size
- slim profile
- easy access to all cards 
- aesthetically pleasing 

The wallet can hold up to 6 cards (with or without embossing). When you have 2+ cards in the wallet, when you open it up the cards will automatically fan out giving you easy access to each card. 

### Headphones

AirPods. I believe that this is the best product that Apple has shipped since iPhone. I  don't say this lightly, but they're as close to "magic" as wireless headphones have ever been. 

- no wires between the left/right _pods_
- case that doubles as a charger
- 90 minute talk time on each _pod_
- can use each _pod_ independently, or together in stereo

## Honorable Mentions

There are a few things that I carry when going to work or to places for a long (3+ hours), that aren't in my "personal" EDC if you will: 

- knife
- tablet
- books/magazines
- games
