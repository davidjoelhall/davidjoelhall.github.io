I may be the weird one in the room, but I track my time. 

My time tracking is not exact to the minute, but I do my best. I started some more projects day-to-day and wanted to make sure that I'm tracking the projects across my systems with consistent names so all the time goes in the appropriate bucket as I get an email report with my time entries. I don't want to have numerous different time entries for the same project, e.g. "Project: network cabinet" is not the same as "Project: setup network cabinet" which is not the same as "Project: network cabinet setup". 

I have:

- project tasks in OmniFocus
- project reference material in DEVONthink
- project time in Toggl (using Timery as an interface)

I create new projects in OmniFocus and DEVONthink with the same name. 

Today, I had the revelation when I start a timer... if I select "Projects:" to:

- get OmniFocus projects
- get name of Project
- set text to "Projects: <OmniFocus Project Name>"
- start timer with description as above text

![OmniFocus Projects Toggl](/images/2020-06-08--timer-project-omnifocus.png)

This ensures that I'm always using the same name in Toggl as I am in OmniFocus as the project name is pulled _from_ OmniFocus.
