There aren't many apps on my home screen nowadays... I've moved everything I don't use regularly into a single folder, therefore leaving only my essentials:
- Fantastical by Flexbits
- Swarm by Foursquare 
- Overcast by Marco Arment
- DEVONthink To Go by DEVONtechnologies
- OmniFocus by The OmniGroup
- LaunchCenterPro by Contrast
- Drafts by Agile Tortoise

The apps not mentioned above that are on my home screen are apps from Apple (or a folder of all my other apps not used regularly):
- Shortcuts
- Photos
- Safari

I use every app on a daily basis and they're core to my say-to-day workflow.
