title: Apple hit the mark with automatic switching on AirPods with iOS 14

This is a situation I came to regularly prior to iOS 14... 

I'm listening to a podcast with iPhone using AirPods. I sit down to watch something on iPad in YouTube... all the while, AirPods are playing my podcast still. I press play on a video in YouTube and the audio comes out of iPad while AirPods are still playing the podcast from iPhone, none the wiser. Many months ago, I created a Shortcut that will switch the playback location on device to AirPods. I invoke the Shortcut and now my AirPods are playing the audio from the video that's on iPad. 

Now, enter iOS 14 with "automatic switching". From Apple: 

> Seamlessly move between devices without manually switching your AirPods. If you finish a phone call on your iPhone and pick up your iPad to watch a movie, AirPods automatically switch over.

Let's try that same situation... 

Instead of the audio coming from *both* sources, the audio being piped into AirPods Pro is automatically switched from the podcast on iPhone to YouTube on iPad. This is *precisely* what I'd expect in this situation. Now... when I'm done in YouTube, the audio doesn't switch back... again, I don't expect it to -- especially if what I was previously watching/listening to was long, that'd be jarring to switch back to the podcast and have it resume. 

There are some infrequent situations where I'd prefer to watch a YouTube video on iPad without hearing the audio... in those situations, I can press the notification and have the audio switch back to the podcast on iPhone.
