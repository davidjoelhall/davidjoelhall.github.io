# iPadOS vs. macOS as a daily driver

Over the years, I've used both operating systems (macOS and iPadOS) regularly. I've gone through stints that macOS was my daily "computer" ([what's a computer](https://youtu.be/pI-iJcC9JUc)) and I'm currently using an iPad Pro (12.9", model year 2018) as my daily computer ([how to use a computer](https://youtu.be/w0P0FQ770dE)). Not if, but when Apple releases their Apple Silicon based Mac laptops, I'm going to take a hard look at them and depending on the features, jump on one. Otherwise, I'll likely pickup a refurb 13" MBP. 

## Why switch from iPadOS to macOS? 

There are multiple apps that I use on iPadOS that just weren't designed to be used there as their main place of use, things like:

- DEVONthink
- OmniFocus

They have apps, but the apps are relatively hamstrung relative to their macOS counterparts. 

Heck, even _simple_ things like FTP transfers are more difficult on iPadOS than they are on macOS. 

## What to do with iPadOS?

I don't foresee myself leaving iPadOS, quite the opposite. iPadOS still has a lot of use for me day-to-day, it'll even likely be where I go to do many tasks, like:

- draw/template ideas in GoodNotes
- Shortcuts, thanks to a larger display
- watching TV shows and movies
- reading in split screen 
- "mobile" computer for short/small tasks (take it with me on trips where I don't _need_ macOS)

The one big benefit of having iPad in a mode designed to accomplish the above tasks is that I'll no longer need a keyboard with it 100%. Currently, I use my iPad Pro in the [Brydge Pro](https://www.brydge.com/products/brydge-pro-keyboard-for-ipad-pro) keyboard, 100% of the time. It's essentially a laptop running iPadOS. While I don't mind this the vast majority of the time... it's a pain to remove the iPad from the rubber hinges when I want to use iPad as, well, an iPad. Sure, I could get [Apple's Magic Keyboard](https://store.apple.com/xc/product/MXQU2LL/A), but it doesn't support the angles the Brydge Pro does and something that I actually do find useful is keeping the Brydge Pro keyboard attached, but backwards... this way I can set iPad Pro with the keyboard flat on a table to draw/write in GoodNotes or similar. 

## A Place For Both

If you were to ask Apple, I'm sure they'd say to use both as there is a place for each in a computer user's life ([The Underdogs](https://youtu.be/G9TdA8d5aaU)). _The Underdogs_ is precisely where I'll be once I bring back macOS into my life.
