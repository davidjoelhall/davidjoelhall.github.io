Open Clipboard in Safari
I find that opening URLs or searching in Safari takes too many taps on iOS. So, I created a [Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/98eebd835aed4803b6af0b3975fd7257). 

This Shortcut does the following:
- Checks clipboard, if it detects "https://" in the contents, it'll open Safari to the page
- Otherwise it'll search Google for the contents of the clipboard 

I keep this Shortcut with 3 other in a medium widget on my iPhone Home Screen. 

Simple. The best Shortcuts are simple.
