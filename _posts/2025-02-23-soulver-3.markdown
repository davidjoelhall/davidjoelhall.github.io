When working with numbers... Sometimes you use a calculator. Sometimes you use a spreadsheet. In many cases, you could use something else that would be better suited for the job. Enter [Soulver 3](https://soulver.app).

I've been using Soulver for years on iPhone and Mac. Soulver 3 will replace Soulver 2 in my workflows. 

Soulver 3 replaces Soulver 2 on my iPhone dock, sharing space with a new tab Safari Shortcut, Drafts, and Camera. 

For nearly everything I work with numbers, I use Soulver. The only time I "promote" the task to a spreadsheet is for when I'm referring to cells or multiple sheets.
