I'm not sure who popularized the term "Fear Of Missing Out" ("FOMO"), but it wasn't a thing when I was a kid... if I had to timestamp it, I'd put it in the early 2000s. 

The thing about FOMO, is no matter how hard you try, how many things you're exposed to, you're going to miss out on _something_. You're one person, in one place, with the same set of 24 hours per day. 

Even in the event that you had access to a transcription of everything that was said in any medium, what can you do with that? Search? Search everything that was ever said? You'll be missing out on so much still, firstly: context. Something said while acting will be said in a different context to someone experiencing it. 

Enjoy what you're doing, be present. If something resonates, take a moment to capture that thought/idea and then reflect on it.
