title:  My Kingdom for a MacBook Pro with built-in Cellular

I'll get right to the point: if Apple changes nothing else on the next series of MacBook Pro with the exception of adding a built-in cellular modem, I'll trade in my otherwise perfectly functioning MacBook Pro for one. 

I've lived the life of using an iPad Pro with cellular, it was... glorious. Not "thinking" about Internet while using a "[computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5BLs51yDQ)" is next level. 

At work, I have a Dell Latitude 7000 series that has built-in cellular. Let me tell you, having a laptop with built-in cellular changes how you can use your laptop. Finishing up a project somewhere, let me type up my notes and get them to the team. I'm not pecking around on a phone, I have a full blown computer with a full keyboard, trackpad, all the apps... etc. 

Let's go!

Remember before cell phones and you could only make calls at home? That's how laptops feel right now. You can only access the outside world when you're "at home" (home, work, coffee shop, etc.). 

What year is it? 

I can already hear the peanut gallery emailing me... 

Tethering is a non-starter. I'm sitting with my iPhone literally next to my Mac. My Mac asks me to connect to the nearby hotspot. It doesn't. Reboot iPhone, nope. Reboot Mac, zilch. Turn off/on Wi-Fi, nada. It doesn't connect. You know what I shouldn't have to do? Tether my Mac to my iPhone to access the outside world. You know what my Mac should be able to do? Access the Internet, by itself. 

Now, sure, if I'm somewhere that doesn't have cellular service, that's an entirely different thing. I'm not saying I should be connecting to satellites, SOS-style, I'm not being ridiculous.
