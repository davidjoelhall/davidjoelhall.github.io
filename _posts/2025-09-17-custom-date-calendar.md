I can't tell yet if this is a stupid idea. I'd like the ability to view custom dates from all of my contacts in a calendar view. I'm not sure why this isn't part of Apple's Calendar, Fantastical's Flexibits, or BusyMac's BusyCal... but it is not. I checked their documentation and reached out to their support. It's not a feature. 

Am I the only one that uses dates like this? Should I use a CRM? I want to have my contacts database that goes to all of my devices. I want to have a calendar that has all of the dates for my contacts. Seems like it'd be a win. 

Here's where I got in ~1 hour with ChatGPT.
