I've had G3 Flex and G4 Instant cameras around at various spots in the house, mounted in various spots -- all using UniFi included hardware. 

I wondered if the G3 Flex and G5 Flex shared the same mounting hardware. Turns out, they do! I tested the pole mount and the ceiling mount, both of which were a no fuss swap. 

1. remove the old camera from the mount
2. unplug Ethernet on old camera
3. plug in Ethernet on new camera
4. install the new camera to the mount

Similar idea for G4 Flex going to G6 Flex. I have this mounted on the included wall mount and it worked like a charm. The U6 Flex is considerably deeper, but thankfully that wasn't a concern in this install. 

Adopted and streaming like nothing happened, albeit we now have better quality to all the upgraded cameras. 

Kudos to the design folks for not changing the mounting hardware, when they definitely could have.
