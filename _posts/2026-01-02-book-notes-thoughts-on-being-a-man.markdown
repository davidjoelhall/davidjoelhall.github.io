> Big dick energy wasn't just a good idea it was fucking mandatory.

> Skateboard, some money, and an Abba-Zaba bar. 

That bar!! So good. Welcome to years of my childhood. I'd leave in the morning with a bus pass, a skateboard, and maybe a few dollars. I'd find myself stopping by a liquor store during the day for a break, grabbing an Abba-Zaba bar and a drink, and then getting back to the day.

Said another way: 

- whole foods vs. heavily processed foods
- reading vs. doom scrolling
