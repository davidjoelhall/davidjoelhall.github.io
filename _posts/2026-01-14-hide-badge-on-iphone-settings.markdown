[Mike Rockwell](https://initialcharge.net/about/) at [initialcharge.net](https://initialcharge.net/) posted [Hide the Notification Badge on the iOS Settings App](https://initialcharge.net/2025/12/settings-app-notification-badge/). 

I read this and hadn't implemented it until it happened to me. 

Apple sent the iOS 26 update to my phone. Now I have the red badge on my settings app. I have no interest in updating to iOS 26 right now. 

So, yeah... I did the same as Mike here: I created a Shortcut to launch Settings to replace the Settings app, because it has a permanent red badge. These are the times we live in. Ridiculous.
