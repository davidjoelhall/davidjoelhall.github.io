## 1. When did you start using plain text?

Somewhere in 2013 it looks like, based on file creation dates in my /Notes/ folder. 

## 2. Why did you start using plain text?

Ease of access from multiple devices. At the time, I was using an iPhone, Windows, and Mac. 

## 3. What do you use plain text for?

I use plain text for just about everything I write: notes (daily, projects), logs, place checkin. 

## 4. What keeps you using plain text?

- I can find what I'm looking for
- Speed 
- Ease of automation
- Can use many tools as a "view" into my files

## 5. Do you use any markup or formatting languages? If so, which ones and why?

Markdown, simple/readable. My blog is on GitHub Pages now and uses Markdown. 

## 6. What are your favorite plain text tools or applications?

1Writer on iOS
TextEdit on macOS
Notepad on Windows

I'm toying with Obsidian here and there as another view to my notes, but I ultimately want to have my notes be accessible without a lot of extra data that's just for aesthetics. 

## 7. Is there one tool you can’t do without?

Nope, if anything stopped working... I'd find another tool on the platform. Right now, I'm using the system tools on desktop operating systems and using 1Writer on mobile. There are other apps available, but this is where I am now. The tools get out of the way. 

## 8. Is there anything you can’t do with plain text?

Not for what I do with my day-to-day, I mean sure... there's a time and place for photos, videos, graphics, etc., but I add those items to the folders along with my notes.
