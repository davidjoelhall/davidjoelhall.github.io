I've been listening to podcasts for 15+ years. 

Since August 2020, I've been bookmarking moments in podcasts that resonate with me... think things like: quotes, ideas, recommendations, anything worth remembering. Here's what that data looks like after 5+ years.

## The Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Episodes with notes | 581 |
| Total bookmarks | 892 |
| Unique podcasts | 106 |
| Avg bookmarks per episode | 1.5 |

## Top Podcasts by Volume

These are the shows I keep coming back to:

| Podcast | Episodes | Bookmarks |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Do By Friday | 68 | 95 |
| The Diary Of A CEO | 52 | 115 |
| Back to Work | 32 | 33 |
| Reconcilable Differences | 30 | 34 |
| Deep Dive with Ali Abdaal | 24 | 44 |
| The Tim Ferriss Show | 24 | 47 |
| Getting Things Done | 21 | 29 |
| Accidental Tech Podcast | 18 | 14 |
| The Joe Rogan Experience | 17 | 38 |
| Tetragrammaton with Rick Rubin | 17 | 25 |

## Episodes That Really Resonated

These episodes had me hitting the bookmark button the most:

| Episode | Podcast | Bookmarks |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Andrew Bustamante | The Diary Of A CEO | 9 |
| Naval Ravikant (#922) | Modern Wisdom | 9 |
| Daniel Ek, Spotify | David Senra | 9 |
| Tony Robbins | The Diary Of A CEO | 8 |
| Dickie Bush | Deep Dive with Ali Abdaal | 8 |
| Nir Eyal | Deep Dive with Ali Abdaal | 8 |
| Naval Ravikant - The Angel Philosopher | The Knowledge Project | 8 |

## Bookmarking Activity Over Time

| Year | Bookmarks |
|------|-----------|
| 2020 | 25 |
| 2021 | 164 |
| 2022 | 81 |
| 2023 | 153 |
| 2024 | 191 |
| 2025 | 248 |
| 2026 | 30 (so far) |

2025 was my most active year—nearly 250 bookmarks. The dip in 2022 is interesting; I'm not sure what happened there.

## Guests I Keep Coming Back To

Some people just consistently deliver value across multiple podcasts:

**Naval Ravikant** (8 episodes)
- Joe Rogan #1309
- Tim Ferriss #473 & #788
- The Knowledge Project #18 & #171
- Modern Wisdom #922
- Arjun Khemani Podcast
- The Beginning of Infinity

**Elon Musk** (7 episodes)
- Joe Rogan #2281 & #2404
- Lex Fridman #400

- Moonshots with Peter Diamandis
- People by WTF

**Tiago Forte** (7 episodes)
- Modern Wisdom #501
- North Star Podcast (3 episodes)
- The Productivity Show
- How I Think
- Building A Second Brain

**Tony Robbins** (5 episodes), **Ryan Holiday** (5 episodes), **Alex Hormozi** (5 episodes)

## Highest Engagement Shows

These podcasts have the highest average bookmarks per episode (minimum 3 episodes):

| Podcast | Avg/Episode | Episodes |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Modern Wisdom | 2.9 | 14 |
| North Star Podcast | 2.5 | 6 |
| The Joe Rogan Experience | 2.2 | 17 |
| The Diary Of A CEO | 2.2 | 52 |
| The Daily Stoic | 2.0 | 8 |
| The Tim Ferriss Show | 2.0 | 24 |

## Fun Facts

- **First bookmark:** August 23, 2020
- **Most bookmarks in one day:** 10 on August 6, 2025
- **One-off listens:** 54 podcasts where I only noted one episode
- **Most active month:** March 2024 (38 bookmarks)

## The Takeaway

This is basically Spotify Wrapped, but for what actually made me think rather than just what I listened to. The bookmark is the signal—it means something was worth capturing.

Looking at this data, I clearly gravitate toward:
- Productivity and GTD content (Do By Friday, Back to Work, Getting Things Done)
- Long-form interview shows (Tim Ferriss, Joe Rogan, Diary of a CEO)
- A handful of guests who consistently deliver (Naval, Tiago Forte, Ryan Holiday)

The episodes with the most bookmarks aren't necessarily from my most-listened shows. David Senra's episode on Daniel Ek got 9 bookmarks from just 2 total episodes I've noted from that podcast. Quality over quantity.
